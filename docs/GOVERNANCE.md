# TextIt Project Governance

*Last updated: July 7, 2025*

## Overview

This document describes the governance model for the TextIt project. It outlines how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and the overall structure of the project leadership.

## Project Roles

### Users

Users are community members who use TextIt. They are the most important members of the community as they provide the purpose for the project. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in various ways, such as:

- Code contributions
- Documentation
- Design
- Translation
- Issue triage
- Answering questions in forums or chat
- Organizing events

Anyone can become a contributor by submitting a pull request, helping with documentation, or participating in discussions.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been given the rights to merge code into the repository. They are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues
- Guiding the technical direction of their components
- Ensuring the quality of the codebase

#### Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have made significant and valuable contributions to the project may be invited to become maintainers. The process is:

1. A contributor is nominated by an existing maintainer
2. The nomination is discussed by the existing maintainers
3. The nomination is approved if there is consensus among the maintainers

### Core Team

The Core Team consists of maintainers who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the project and have taken on additional responsibilities for the overall health and direction of the project. The Core Team:

- Sets the overall technical direction of the project
- Makes decisions when maintainer consensus cannot be reached
- Manages the TextIt brand
- Manages project resources
- Resolves conflicts within the community

## Decision Making

### Consensus-Based Approach

TextIt follows a consensus-based approach to decision-making. For most decisions, we seek input from all stakeholders and try to find a solution that addresses everyone's concerns.

### Lazy Consensus

For day-to-day decisions, we follow a "lazy consensus" model. A proposal is considered accepted if:

1. It was properly communicated to the relevant stakeholders
2. No one objects within a reasonable timeframe (usually one week for minor changes, two weeks for significant changes)

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, the Core Team may call for a vote. Voting is done using the following system:

- +1: Approve
- 0: Neutral
- -1: Disapprove (must include reasoning)

A proposal passes if:
- It receives more +1 votes than -1 votes
- At least 50% of Core Team members have voted
- No Core Team member has vetoed the proposal (a -1 vote with a compelling reason)

## Communication

The project uses the following primary communication channels:

- GitHub issues and pull requests for code-related discussions
- Mailing lists for broader discussions
- Chat platforms for real-time communication
- Regular video meetings for synchronous discussions

All project decisions must be documented and publicly accessible.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the TextIt community are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The Core Team is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require approval from the Core Team. Proposed changes should be submitted as pull requests and will be subject to the decision-making process outlined above.

## Project Resources

The following resources are managed by the Core Team:

- GitHub organization and repositories
- Domain names and websites
- Social media accounts
- Financial resources and sponsorships
- Trademarks and other intellectual property

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflicts between community members:

1. The involved parties should attempt to resolve the conflict directly
2. If that fails, they can request mediation from a maintainer
3. If mediation is unsuccessful, the issue can be escalated to the Core Team
4. The Core Team's decision is final

## Acknowledgment

This governance model is inspired by successful open-source projects and is designed to evolve as the TextIt project grows.
